# 1st Method
a = int(input("Enter the First Number (a): \n"))
b = int(input("Enter the Second Number (b) : \n"))
a = a+b
b = a-b
a = a-b
print(f"Swapped numbers are a = {a} and b = {b} \n")

#2nd method

a1 = int(input("Enter the First Number (a1) : \n"))
b1 = int(input("Enter the Second Number (b1) : \n"))
c=a1
a1=b1
b1=c
print(f"Swapped numbers are  = {a1} and b = {b1} \n")

#3rd method only in Python
a,b = b,a

#4th Method
xor
